# Semiotic Introduction to Path Semantics
by Sven Nilsen, 2025

From [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics):

"Semiotics is the study of signs. It is an interdisciplinary field that examines what signs are, how they form sign systems,
and how individuals use them to communicate meaning.
Its main branches are syntactics, which addresses formal relations between signs, semantics,
which addresses the relation between signs and their meanings, and pragmatics,
which addresses the relation between signs and their users.
Semiotics is related to linguistics but has a broader scope that includes nonlinguistic signs, such as maps and clothing."

For clarity, I will write this introduction to Semiotics in the following way:

- Syntactics: Formal relations between signs
- Semantics: Relations between signs and their meanings
- Pragmatics: Relations between signs and their users

`Semiotics = Syntactics + Semantics + Pragmatics`

Path Semantics is a relatively recently established field that studies how people use symbols.

There are people from all sorts of fields in science that work on problems in Path Semantics.

- A logician might work on logical problems
- A semiotician might work on semiotic problems
- A language designer might work on language design problems

A Path Semanticist is somebody who specifically trained themselves, to bring the various parts of Path Semantics into a single project.
Path Semanticists need to build on a lot of knowledge to figure out whether something is particular for Path Semantics,
or whether it belongs to some other field of science.
There are cross-disciplines in Path Semantics, but Path Semantics itself is also a field on its own.

Now, this can be confusing for multiple reasons, but I will go through it step by step.
Hopefully, at the end, you will have developed a better intuition of what Path Semantics is.

- [Why Semantics instead of Syntactics or Pragmatics, or Semiotics in general?](#why-semantics-instead-of-syntactics-or-pragmatics-or-semiotics-in-general)
- [Why is Semiotics in general not regarded as part of Path Semantics?](#why-is-semiotics-in-general-not-regarded-as-part-of-path-semantics)

This introduction is not meant to discourage people from contributing to Path Semantics.
It is about the overall direction of the Path Semantics project and what it takes to become a Path Semanticist.
There are many challenges in Path Semantics that require top expertise from other disciplines.
Most likely, experts in various fields are better equiped to solve specific problems than the average Path Semanticist.
Still, even with top expertise in some field, it is not certain that it is easy to grasp a Path Semantical perspective.

### Why symbols instead of signs?

A symbol is a sign that you can not understand simply by looking at it.
Somebody needs to explain it to you, or you have to read about it first to understand it.

In Path Semantics, we say that symbols have more arbitrariness than signs in general.

This might seem like a severe limitation at first sight:
If the signs that people study under Path Semantics are arbitrary associated with various meanings,
then what kind of interesting stuff can possibly come out of it?

Well... you might not think there could not be anything interesting from the definition alone...
but when you start to think more deeply about it, there are many examples and they go very, very deep.

One obvious example is computer memory.
Almost all computers in the world use bits to store memory.
From a mathematical point of view, computer memory is a sequence of 1s and 0s.

The 1s and 0s in computer memory are symbols, because their meanings are arbitrary associated.
We use programming languages to assist in the construction of computer memory semantics.
Hence, programming as a whole might be thought of as a part of Path Semantics.

Path Semantics is much broader than programming, but programming is an important part of it.

Another example is mathematics in general.
In mathematics, people use symbols.
It is rare that people use signs in mathematics that you can understand by simply looking at them.
To learn mathematical notation, people need somebody to explain it to them, or they have to read about it first to understand it.

Path Semantics is much broader than mathematics, but mathematics is an important part of it.

Yet another example is Artificial Intelligence (AI).
In AI, machine learning algorithms construct semantics of computer memory on their own (at least partially).
These algorithms learn from interacting with an environment or from data.
To make these algorithms flexible, they need symbols, specifically in the sense of arbitrariness.

Path Semantics is much broader than AI, but AI is an important part of it.

Now, you see from these 3 examples, that Path Semantics is not very limited.
In fact, a lot of smart people around the world work on programming, mathematics and AI.
Path Semanticists do similar work to what these smart people do, but at a higher level.
Path Semantics is a field on its own, which few people dare to explore,
unless they are already familiar with programming, mathematics and AI.

The reason so few people do Path Semantics, is because Path Semantics is harder to learn.

For example, let us say that you have studied Logic for 50 years.
Even when you have studied something for this long time,
it is still not certain that you will understand the Path Semantical perspective of what you are an expert on.

In the foundation of Path Semantics, you will be confronted with Logic at the hardest level in existence.
This how hard Logic gets, before it turns into Statistics and Probability Theory.
In Statistics and Probability Theory, we do not know what we are talking about, but we make approximate semantics.
The foundation of Path Semantics is the last outpost, as far anyone has ever went with Logic.

It is possible to study Logic for 50 years and still feel completely lost when trying to understand the foundation of Path Semantics.

This does not mean that if people do not grasp the foundation of Path Semantics, that they are bad at e.g. Logic.
On the contrary, you can be a top expert in a field, but you can still be bad at doing Path Semantics.

Path Semantics is simply a field on its own, that people study.
Like every field, people learn from other people in the same field and build on each other's knowledge.

In Semotics, people study signs.

In Path Semantics, people study how people use symbols.

Notice the difference: Path Semanticists do not study symbols, but how people use symbols.
From a Semiotic perspective, there is an element of Pragmatics in Path Semantics,
because the relation between signs and their users is part of Pragmatics.

However, in Path Semantics, we are not studying the Pragmatics of how people use symbols.
Instead, we are studying the Semantics of how people use symbols.
This means, since symbols have arbitrarily assigned meanings,
there are logical consequences that follow from using signs in this particular way.
We are not interested in empirical measurements, or statistics, of how people use symbols.
In Path Semantics, we are theoretical oriented, thinking about it from a more abstract view.

Yet, while being more theoretical than Pragmatics,
it is also true that Path Semanticists rely much less on very abstract models of mathematics,
such as Higher Category Theory.

Higher Category Theory provides a useful perspective on Path Semantics for some insights,
but at the end of the day, it will probably not going to help you understand Path Semantics very well.
The real craft of Path Semantics is in specific details that are not captured by Higher Category Theory.

To learn Path Semantics, the only known method today is to train yourself with automated theorem provers,
preferable of the more generic kind than those that are more language specific (e.g. First Order Logic or Calculus of Constructions).
While First Order Logic and Calculus of Constructions have deep traditions in the mathematical community and the field of computer science,
they are not good enough language tools for Path Semantics.

In Path Semantics, we study how people use symbols.
To really grasp how people use symbols from a perspective of Semantics,
you can not spend too much time on particular topics that are mostly irrelevant, e.g. First Order Logic versus Second Order Logic.
If you get stuck on issues like quantifying over predicates or not, then Path Semantics might not be for you.

It is perfectly fine to be interested in these things as an expert on Logic,
and you can probably spend your entire life studying these things,
but in Path Semantics we are more concerned about how people use symbols in general,
from a more theoretical point of view, the Semantics side of it, than the Pragmatics side.

The foundation of Path Semantics is mostly Propositional Logic, or Zeroth Order Logic.
Now, most mathematicians and logicians do not find this level of Logic interesting, because they believe it has already been explored and is well understood.

If you believe this too, then you are probably too indoctrinated to learn Path Semantics.
Perhaps you should consider giving up and just stay in your field.

Either you are willing to be confronted with Logic at the hardest level in existence,
or you are not yet intellectually mature enough to take on this challenge.

Path Semantics might not be something you are capable of learning now.
You could try again in 5 or 10 years and see if you get further with the experience you have gained in the mean time.

I am not saying these things to be condescending or something.
Path Semantics is simply a field on its own, which might not give you the things you are looking for.
It can be hard for some people's Ego to learn that, even at the top of their game,
there is so much beyond, that they feel like all they have learned so far, is almost nothing in comparison.

This happens because Path Semantics is at the boundary between Mathematics and Semiotics.
Think of Mathematics and Semiotics as two cities, surrounded by wilderness.
It is more comfortable to stay safe in the fields of Mathematics or Semiotics in isolation,
where your mental models largely go unchallenged, than in this unsafe theoretical landscape between them,
which makes you feel small and insignificant.

One thing is to compare yourself to other people.
However, when you climb mountains, it is dangerous to think that way.
You can easily cause an unsafe situation, just because you are trying to do something you are not capable of handling.

Most intellectuals grow up in a social environment where they have been cuddled all their life.
As a result, on average, they are often more eccentric and less emotional mature than most people.
So, when you give them a challenge of figuring out "how people use symbols",
they will probably fail at it and make little progress.

A good Path Semanticist is somebody who usually has 20 years of experience from another field, but wants to move on.
These years of experience serve as a backbone for what they will be doing in the coming years.
They understand this situation as another phase in life, where the stuff they will be doing are different from what they did before.
So, they expect that they have to learn new things and in the process, get worse at some of the skills they have built up so far.
However, this is the prize for moving on.

Path Semanticists do not study signs in general.
If you want to study signs in general, then you should study Semiotics, not Path Semantics.
Likewise, Path Semanticists do not study extremely abstract models like Higher Category Theory.
If you are interested in Higher Category Theory, then you should study Higher Category Theory.

Some people venture into Path Semantics in hope that it will help them learn a wide area of topics.
It is true that Path Semantics builds bridges between many domains of human knowledge.
However, this does not imply that Path Semantics is easy to learn.
You will probably be better off by learning a particular field you are interested in.

If you are reading this, then you are probably looking for something.
You are likely on a quest, interested in new perspectives and want to experience new things.

If you are looking for new things, learning Path Semantics will give you everything you wish for and even more.
However, it will only result in new research questions and make you feel smaller than ever before.
It will come with a haunting realization of how little you actually know.

This is why I am saying, that if you are reading this, you are probably heading in the wrong direction.
Turn back! Retrace your steps that brought you here and find another way.

The arbitrariness of symbols, compared to signs, hides an enormous amount of secret knowledge.
This secret knowledge is not for everybody.

### Why Semantics instead of Syntactics or Pragmatics, or Semiotics in general?

Stupid people think that when you are making the definition of your own field more universal,
it becomes more powerful. So, they try to come up with as broad definition as possible,
to maximize the freedom of what they will be working on.

Path Semantics is the very extreme opposite of this mindset.

The major focus in Path Semantics has been to narrow stuff down, so we know what to focus on.
There are too many things that are going on, so reducing the scope of things has been our approach to make sense of all this complexity.

One reason why Path Semantics has become so applicable, is because we failed at our goal.

It turned out that the foundation of Path Semantics is much smarter than we are.
The foundation tricked us into thinking that we understood it.
We felt near the finish line.
Instead, it just opened up new doors to entire new worlds of knowledge.

The simple reason that Semantics became the focus, is because of the idea of using normal paths to construct meaning.

For example, when you concatenate two lists, the length of the new list is the sum of the lengths of the two original lists:

```
len(concat(a, b)) = len(a) + len(b)
```

In Path Semantical notation, we can write this the following way:

```
concat[len x len -> len] <=> add
```

Or simply:

```
concat[len] <=> add
```

This is a normal path.

Normal paths occur naturally in various processes where people use symbols.

When people use symbols, there is seemingly nothing in particular about the Syntactics,
nor the Pragmatics, that determines the meaning of a normal path.
As far as we know, the reason why there are normal paths is a Semantical phenomena.

The Path Semantics project was started to research normal paths in more precise detail,
so we could learn why composition of normal paths did not work in Dependent Types.

Composition of normal paths works in Dependent Types, as long there is a underlying model of the parts:

```
f[g1][g2] <=> f[g2 . g1]
```

The above statement is provable, as long `f[g1]` has some solution, e.g. `h` and `h[g2]` has some solution.

In general, composition of normal paths works.
The problem is that there is no underlying mathematical model.
This transformation works at the symbolic level of language.

With other words, the way people use composition of normal paths,
is through arbitrary assigning meaning to some symbols,
which has no basis in what might be understood as an "underlying reality".

We humans like to rationalize use of symbols by providing mathematical models for systems that we design.
However, in general, we simply use symbols with arbitrary meaning attached to them, because they work in real life.

This has nothing to do with the Syntactics or Pragmatics sides of people using signs.
Often, people apply Pragmatics to oppose a more theoretical point of view,
as if there is some relation between users of signs and what they can do with them.

I believe that people tend to do this, because it gives them a sense of personal freedom.
However, I also believe that it is mostly rationalization,
because we do not like how symbols with arbitrary meanings attached to them
have great power over human behavior.

The realization I had was that Mathematics as a whole starts with some level of language, where meaning is arbitrary attached to symbols.

In Mathematics, the choices we make when assigning meaning to symbols arbitrarily,
have logical consequences.

Therefore, we can study Mathematics from a philosophical perspective where meaning is attached to symbols arbitrarily,
but we can use Logic to study the specific mechanism.
While Logic has a different language bias than various implementations of some language design,
it can inform us and assist in making new insights.

The logical consequences that follow from making design decisions, give rise to what we think of as mathematical objects.
Instead of seeing this as a project that can be completed, people continue to make more and more design choices over time,
some design choices that might conflict with each other.

Therefore, as these design choices are made arbitrarily, Path Semanticists do not view Mathematics as a whole as a consistent framework.
In principle, Mathematics as a whole might be inconsistent, but locally consistent when you stick to a particular path of design choices.

Hence, the name "Path Semantics".

Path Semantics is not the same as Mathematics in general.
Mathematics is part of Path Semantics, but Path Semantics is more fundamental.

Path Semantics is the study of how people use symbols.

Now, why not just think of Path Semantics is a sub-field of Semiotics?

In one sense, Path Semantics is a sub-field of Semiotics.
However, most of Semoitics is simply irrelevant for Path Semanticists.
We do not need to think that much about Syntactics, nor about Pragmatics.
There is also just one particular kind of sign we are studying: Symbols.

The use of symbols provides a nice abstraction, that covers lots of domains of human knowledge.
It makes it easy to build language bridges between domains,
without getting stuck on Ontology or specific Pragmatics that is related to some domain.

Arbitrariness of symbols makes them easier to reason about than signs, not harder.

The downside is that Path Semantics itself is hard to learn, because it is about constructing arbitrary meaning.
You can also not assume stuff like First Order Logic, for the very same reason: First Order Logic is constructed arbitrarily.

Most of the time in the foundation of Path Semantics, we use Propositional Logic (Zeroth Order Logic),
because we can use tricks that makes it more powerful; as powerful as Higher Order Logic.
Technically, we are working with Propositional Logic, but it is not as limiting as it sounds.

Propositional Logic has some of the same arbitrariness that we use with symbols in language.
Formally, we think about symbols as a specific construct within Propositional Logic.
This construct does not exist in e.g. Lambda Calculus.

Even if you are a computer scientist and have studied Lambda Calculus your entire life,
then you can still know basically nothing about Path Semantics.

For the same reason, when logicians think about First Order Logic versus Second Order Logic,
they operate without symbols, which have an element of Syntactics.
Second Order Logic is basically attempting to reintroduce some of the power of symbols,
by quantifying over predicates, but it is using the wrong language tool for the job.

This is how people can study these fields their entire lives,
while Path Semantics still hits all their blind spots.
Leaving out these elementary building blocks of language,
it makes people feel that, when they start learning Path Semantics,
they have to start over and know basically nothing again.

It is not like there are just some small gaps in these people's knowledge and experience.
How people use symbols, is the ONLY thing that Path Semanticists study.
Not just a missing building block, but an entire field that is missing.

Path Semantics is not Semiotics in general, because that would be a too broad scope for research.
Semiotics is the study of signs. Path Semantics is the study of how people use symbols.
Technically, Path Semantics is a sub-field of Semiotics, but it is so deep that it has become a field on its own.

### Why is Semiotics in general not regarded as part of Path Semantics?

From the assumptions that are made in Path Semantics, we can not argue about Ontology in general.

This is because meaning in Path Semantics is arbitrarily constructed.
When meaning is arbitrarily constructed, there is no clear distinction between reality and fiction.

Do you see how this works?

Without Ontology, we lack the language tools in Path Semantics to talk about things that are usually of interest in Semiotics.

We do not claim that we understand Semiotics, nor Ontology, nor regard them as "useless" in some sense.
Not at all. We simply do not talk about these things.

The only thing that matters in Path Semantics, are design choices people make when they construct meaning.

For example, in Philosophy, there are highly relevant questions to Ontology, like these ones:

- Is time real?
- Is money real?

From the perspective of Path Semantics, we have no idea how to answer such questions.
All we can talk about, is different perspectives people have about time and money.
We can address these questions indirectly by presenting different ideas and opinions people have,
but we have no language tool in Path Semantics that tells us "the answer".

These are things outside the scope of Path Semantics.
We do not study those things, so we can focus on stuff that is relevant to our own field instead.

Remember, people who are Path Semanticists are not just Path Semanticists, but also human beings with personal opinions.
However, there is a difference between how you think about stuff from the perspective of Path Semantics,
and when you think as a person in general.

When you work as a Path Semanticist, people expect that you do what Path Semanticists do,
not what logicians, or mathematicians, or philosophers do.
Path Semantics is a distinct field on its own, similar to how a surgeon is generally not considered the same job in medicine as a dentist.

We Path Semanticists can talk about Ontology, but only as far people make different choices of Ontology.
As far as Path Semantics is concerned, various ontologies that people use, are arbitrary meanings that people attach to symbols.
Now, this assumption might be wrong in real life.
However, we make this assumption for the whole field of Path Semantics, to simplify what we pay attention to and work on.

Path Semantics do not just study stuff like programming, mathematics and AI.
We also study religion from a Path Semantical perspective.
In that sense, we do not think about religion as real or fictional.
We look at religion as arbitrary meaning that people construct.
Now, when you view religion this way, this tends to lean toward fictional by default.
However, it does not have to be entirely fictional, but can also be a mixture of what people perceive as real
with meanings that are fictional in nature, but thought to be real in some sense.
What we study is how people construct the meaning, the Semantics, from their use of symbols.

In Path Semantics, we are not measuring how many people believe what, at difference places and time periods in history.
We are interested in the change of beliefs over time and how historical events influence the choices people make.

When there is a surviving text written by some historical person,
we do not assume that this text is representative of what people in general believed at the time.
General belief in this sense is often irrelevant.
Frequently, various scholars make complex hypotheses about developments of ideas.
In reality, such hypotheses can be over-simplistic and more useful as a tool to think outside the box for people today,
than some actual accurate model of things the way they happened.
Sometimes, we can not discern truth from friction based on of available evidence.
What we can do, is to learn from e.g. language biases in general and apply this knowledge to new areas.

Path Semanticists are not archeologists, nor historians, nor philologists.
In the field of Path Semantics, we focus on doing Path Semantics.
Based on our work, other experts in their own fields might go look for new evidence or develop new ideas.
If you are interested in Path Semantics, but also want to make important contributions that require Ontology,
then you should consider staying in another field where you can talk about Ontology.

Do not come to Path Semantics expecting that it will be a kind of "magical solution" that fixes all obstacles in other fields.
Path Semantics is not Semiotics, for the precise reason that Semiotics is concerned about a lot of things that are not addressed by Path Semantics.
In Path Semantics, you will probably feel a lot more lost in the theoretical wilderness,
a lot more confused about all the things we do not know yet,
plus that you will feel less hope that we ever can address the things you might want to know, from a Path Semantical perspective.
This is the prize you pay for using the extraordinary powerful language tools in Path Semantics.

Path Semanticists usually become experts on how people use language tools across many domains of human knowledge.
They can often distinguish different language tools by analyzing their language biases,
which might be used to predict various weaknesses and strengths language tools will have.

Path Semanticists often train themselves by designing lots of language tools over time.
This means some Path Semanticists are experts in designing particular language tools.
However, this does not imply that this domain specific knowledge of design transfers easily to new domains.

Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) was one of the first philosophers that disregarded underlying models in the way people used language.
In his early philosophy, he thought there were things you can say and things you can not say.
His criteria of the things you can say meaningfully, are those that corresponds to some world of facts.
In his later philosophy, he corrected this idea to humans participating in many language games,
that overlap with each other through resemblance of similar rules.
When we move from one language game to another, we change the rules of the game,
which despite a seemingly simple change, might radically transform the underlying model.

In Path Semantics, we do not assume any underlying model.

One obvious example is Music.

In Music, there might be sounds that resemble or imitate sounds from real life.
Yet, in general, Music does not need any underlying model to qualify as Music.
Instead, it is better to think about Music as a creative mental space,
where the listener is constructing their own meaning on the fly.
This construction of meaning is made arbitrarily, because notes in Music are symbols, not merely signs.
Music can easily become powerful emotionally to people, not because meaning is imposed from the outside,
but because people construct the meaning themselves, hence pouring their own creativity into it.
The biggest emotional impacts we get through life, come from things which meaning we have created ourselves.

Thus, Wittgenstein might have gotten this backwards.
His philosophy is centered around starting with models and later relax them to include more human activities.
In Path Semantics, we start with no model at all, but language tools that people use to construct meaning arbitrarily.
The most important idea that Wittgenstein had in this context, was the problem of synthesizing Logic vs Language.

Therefore, it is natural to think of Wittgenstein as being wrong from a Path Semantical perspective.
Yet, when Wittgenstein changed his perspective over time, he moved in a similar direction to the assumptions that Path Semanticists work from.
Path Semantics is more or less focusing on the same problem that Wittgenstein worked on,
but the synthesis is not something unspoken or lacking: The result is a human synthesis.

People use symbols in particular ways because they work in real life.
The answer is not always given by some external world, but in the Pragmatics.
Yet, this form of Pragmatics might not be purely Pragmatical, but more Semantical instead.

For example, when people use composition of normal paths,
it is not just a compromise with some practicality.
Perhaps it is more like an idealization of the language tool,
where the language tool transcends any underlying model and reaches another stage of abstraction: The symbolic.

In this creative space, the symbolic is not lacking anything.
What might seem like an error or imperfection from one point of view,
might be the very desirable property itself in another perspective.

It is kind of like some form of beautification, an idealization, beyond what is merely possible.
The symbolic stage transcends what is possible, to include things that might be impossible.
Despite these things are given an impossible meaning, it might still have a huge impact on people, because it is arbitrary constructed.

Because it is hard to quantify such language designs using objective criteria,
the tendency is that Path Semantics blurs the boundary between what is a more Logical perspective,
with what is closer to Art.
In the Art, there are so many possibilities, that the old and comfortable language boundaries break down,
where creation and destruction blend into each other to form higher dualities.

Path Semantics is the field that studies how people use symbols.
However, since people are frequently using symbols at the level of Art in their own lives,
it means you have to be prepared for things to move closer to the Art,
instead of being closer to stuff like validity or verification.

This is another reason why so few people manage to learn Path Semantics well.
In the foundation of Path Semantics, it operates at the hardest level of Logic in existence.
This level of hardness is out of the box, before you even started building anything.
Where you proceed from there, is up to you.
Nobody can really understand with certainty what you are doing, because like in an artistic process,
an artist usually does not understand consciously what they are doing.

Art can be a fragile process. This is part of the seducing beauty of it.

When humans make plans for the future, we tend to think that every step will go smoothly without problems.
This is rarely how things turn out, but also, we soon forget that the past was full of problems and challenges.
Next morning, we wake up, full of optimism again.

When people are given a chance to explore the space of creating arbitrary meaning,
it is almost guaranteed that some of them will come up with amazing things that gain significant cultural influence.
For some, it can be liberating to get more freedom to explore things from a very different perspective.
A few people pay a high prize for this freedom: Unforeseen consequences.

If you come from a mathematical background, then perhaps you should consider first studying some Semiotics,
to ground yourself in another way of thinking, before you venture into Path Semantics.
Likewise, if you come from the Semiotics side, then perhaps you would benefit more from studying Mathematics first.
You can always come back to Path Semantics later, when you feel more prepared.

Every good Path Semanticist is a person that has a lot of experience from other fields.
We do not consider high achievements in the past, as something that makes one Path Semanticist more excellent than another.
That can be a dangerous mindset, because when people try to outsmart each other, they might push themselves too far.

Out here, it is only you and the mountain.

You learn to know the mountain. You learn to respect the mountain.

Just like in rock climbing: Safety first.

If you struggle giving up your Ego, in the face of the hardest theoretical challenges there are,
then at least admit it to yourself and give up already, before you put yourself in danger.

Most likely, nobody will ever give you a reward for working on Path Semantics.
You can not get a job working as a Path Semanticist today.
The only people who will understand what you are doing, are other Path Semanticists.
They too, will have moved on from their own fields, to enter a new phase in their own lives.

If you have seconds thoughts about giving up some of your hard-gained skills to become a Path Semanticist,
then you are probably better off continuing in your own field.

Path Semantics is not a field that top experts in every field converge toward over time.
It is a field on its own, so difficult to learn that you pretty much need to be a top expert even to begin.
We are not promising that you will reach "another stage of nirvana".
Think of it as just another field, concerned about other things than the field in which you are currently studying.

To study Path Semantics, you have to be interested in how people use symbols.

Not signs. Symbols.

Path Semantics is a very constrained field in one sense, to focus the research on how people use symbols specifically.
It just happens that people use symbols in every field of human knowledge.
The reason Path Semantics is so useful across fields, is mostly coincidental and not by design.

We are not trying to make Path Semantics something it is not.
This field has the same kind of problems that have always been the research interest from its beginning.
You will probably discover that these research interests are not the ones you thought were most interesting.
This happens to every person that enter Path Semantics:
It turns out, that it is just another field and not the dream version of their own field that they had in mind.

I am not trying to discourage you from learning Path Semantics.
This is a frequent problem, because some people think we are lying and trying to trick them with reverse psychology.

I am just being honest about what you might expect.
Path Semantics is not about Ontology, so the "truth of the universe and everything" is not something you will find here.

Yet, some people will ignore this warning anyway, because they think they are smarter than me.
In that case, please go on. Remember this: I warned you.

In 10 years, you will say the exact same things as me to a new person, who nobody can stop from studying.
That person, who simply wants to know what Path Semantics is.

I told you all this time. You don't have to spend 10 years before you realize it:

Path Semantics is the study of how people use symbols.

You will just spend these 10 years creating arbitrary meaning, that you assign to the sentence above.

Now, you can not understand it, unless you have created it, right?

This is how you begin.
